          <h3>Grips</h3>
          <p>
            The scenario above paints the picture of why grips should be treated
            as more than just an accessory in badminton. Finding the right
            badminton grip is quite critical to the success of a badminton
            player and when properly chosen, will enhance their play style.
            While it may not be as important as choosing the right racket, a
            properly selected grip can amplify a player’s power or control.
            Fundamentally, grips are chosen to fit the taste of the player, be
            it tacky, dry, thin or thick!
