            Growing up in the United States, children are introduced to
            badminton as just another sport to be learned though Physical
            Education (P.E.) classes in primary schools. Due to the low presence
            of the sport in our neighborhoods, there were very few facilities
            available for hobbyists and even fewer gyms dedicated to the
            training and coaching of competitive players. During our college
            days was where badminton became more than a sport. It transformed
            into a community. A haven of like-minded individuals who challenged
            each other to improve the level of play, who competed side-by-side
            to achieve greater accolades, and who laughed, bonded and grew as a
            team. Who knew that such camaraderie could be derived from a “P.E.”
            sport?

            Our mission is to change the perception of badminton, to give it the
            credibility it deserves as the fastest racket sport in the world. We
            aim to serve fellow badminton enthusiasts bites of badminton
            information across all facets of the sport. Ranging from basic
            knowledge of the rules and regulations of badminton to reviews of
            equipment, strategies, gameplay statistics and current events,
            BadmintonBites offers something for everyone. In the end, we hope to
            achieve the expansion of badminton communities worldwide so others
            can experience the joy, competitiveness and excitement that this
            sport can offer!
